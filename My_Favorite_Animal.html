    Choosing a favorite was a terribly hard choice to make because many different animals could have filled that spot: I feel like a lion in my spirit, I find myself in the vibe of an eagle at times, dogs love me, I fancy cats, and horses thrill me, but hey, elephants take the cake.

Elephants. Oh, they are like the grandmother of the forest, from their high consciousness and intellect, to their care so powerful it literally moves the nature of both forest and savannah to make life comfortable for other animals.
<br>
Check out these little-known facts about our long-trunk friends.
<ol>
<li>With the soles of their feet they can sense the low-frequency vibrations of a storm, and they use this to trace where it has rained even hundreds of miles away. They are even able to communicate their own low-frequency vibrations to their family far away to tell them <em>hey, there is water over here.</em></li>

<li>Elephants are one of a handful of animals that can recognize themselves in a mirror, which is a sign of high self-awareness. We know this because when researchers rub paint on a part of an elephant’s body that it couldn’t see without a mirror, and the elephant sees the mark in the mirror, it actually uses the mirror to investigate the mark. It knows <em>this is me, but what did this guy put on my body!</em></li>

<li>My favorite fact when I discovered it is this: elephants pull down trees and clear vegetation to make way for water to flow. They modify the environment to benefit not just them, but all the animals and plants in that area. That’s why I call them <em>the forest’s grandmother</em>. Love, love, love!</li>

We haven’t even talked about the cooling system in their ears, or the thousand things they can do with their trunks, or how some of them can paint on canvas! And yeah, their social structures are complex. They console their peers, and have intricate morning rituals. I imagine Daddy Lephie going like, <em>goodnight boys, don’t forget we have meditation in the morning.</em>

I should say at this point that I finally figured out why I felt okay choosing an animal you can hardly own as my favorite, and it is because even the animals people do own should not be owned. Animals are sentient, conscious and should not be seen as property to handle as if they lacked the same thing that animates us. Pun intended.
<br>
That’s it for favorite animal. Hope this was fun and enlivening.
